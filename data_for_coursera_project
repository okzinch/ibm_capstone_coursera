Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults: This set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit.

For the analysis, the following data will be used: Age, Gender, Education, Handness, MMSE, CDR, eTIV, nWBV.eTIV, nWBV comprise brain data, while Age, Gender, Education, Handness, MMSE, CDR comprise psychological examination and demographic data.

We will use these sets of variables to predict the Group of the current data point (assigned to the patient) - diagnosed with dementia or not.

The data will be evaluated with Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression to obtain a better predictive model by comparison.
